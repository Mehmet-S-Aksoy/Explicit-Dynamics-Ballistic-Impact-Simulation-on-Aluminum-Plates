# Explicit-Dynamics-Ballistic-Impact-Simulation-on-Aluminum-Plates
This repository presents an explicit dynamics simulation of ballistic impact on aluminum plates, analyzing two types of projectiles (oval and sharp-nosed). The study evaluates the deformation and penetration potential using FEA with non-linear material properties, offering insights into material behavior under high-speed impacts.
