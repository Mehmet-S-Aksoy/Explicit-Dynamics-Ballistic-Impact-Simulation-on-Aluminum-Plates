- FEA model with **non-linear material properties** for the aluminum plate.
- Detailed results of the **deformation** caused by each projectile type.
- Step-by-step simulation process for accurate tracking and data collection.
- Simulations conducted in **ANSYS** with a focus on material behavior and deformation analysis.


## Simulation Overview:

This project involves simulating the impact of two types of projectiles (oval-shaped and sharp-nosed) on an aluminum plate using **explicit dynamics**. The plate is subjected to projectiles at a constant velocity, and the simulation explores how each shape affects the plate's deformation and penetration capabilities.


The **explicit dynamics** analysis captures the transient response of the system under impact, which is crucial for studying high-speed events like ballistic impacts. The simulation uses a **non-linear material model** for the aluminum plate to closely match real-world behavior under stress. The results show that the sharp-nosed projectile caused significantly more deformation (0.544 meters) than the oval-shaped one (0.044 meters), indicating that the shape of the projectile plays a key role in its ability to penetrate materials.


## Simulation Setup and Methodology:

1. **Material Properties**: Aluminum plate was defined with **non-linear material characteristics** to capture realistic behavior under impact.
2. **Geometry and Meshing**: Proper meshing techniques were applied to ensure accurate results. The mesh was refined around the impact zone to capture detailed deformation.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The projectiles were assigned a constant velocity, and the appropriate friction coefficients were considered to simulate realistic conditions.
4. **Analysis Type**: **Explicit dynamics** was used to analyze the dynamic impact event. This method is particularly suited for problems involving high velocities and large deformations.
5. **Results**: The deformation of the aluminum plate was measured for both projectile types, showcasing significant differences between the two.
